# The Resolutions
The following are broken into 45m sections which my wife and learned from the 75 Hard Challenge in the previous year. 
1. Bible, Prayer, Reading a Book (non-fiction) 10 minutes
2. Exercise once a day
3. Creative Time (Side hustles, art, music, sowing, crafts, etc)
4. Project Time (Getting those big projects done, one bite at a time)
