### **1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines to automate code integration, testing, and deployment processes.
- Ensure reliable and frequent deployment of software with minimal downtime.
- Automate build, test, and release processes.


### **2. Monitoring and Logging**
- Set up monitoring tools to ensure system health and performance (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- Implement logging solutions (e.g., ELK Stack) to track application behavior and troubleshoot issues.
- Analyze monitoring and logging data to identify and resolve bottlenecks or failures.


### **3. Automation and Scripting**
- Automate repetitive operational tasks to reduce manual errors and save time.
- Develop scripts for deployment, backup, and monitoring tasks.
- Write tools to support developers and operations teams.


### **4. Collaboration and Communication**
- Facilitate better communication between developers, managment, and product teams.
- Advocate for a DevOps culture that emphasizes shared responsibility and continuous improvement.
- Support cross-functional teams in understanding production environments and infrastructure.


### **5. Cloud and Infrastructure Management**
- Manage or optimize cloud services (Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub, Artifactory ) or on-premise infrastructure.
- Ensure high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of infrastructure.
- Implement and enforce security best practices.


### **6. Security and Compliance**
- Integrate security practices into CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps).
- Conduct vulnerability assessments and implement fixes.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.


### **7. Configuration Management**
- Ensure that configurations are version-controlled and reproducible.
- Currently done manually, would like to handle in automated fashion in future.


### **8. Performance Optimization**
- Analyze system performance and optimize for scalability and efficiency.
- Conduct load testing and ensure systems can handle peak traffic.


### **9. Incident Management and Troubleshooting**
- Actively monitor for issues and respond to incidents.
- Create and maintain runbooks to quickly address recurring issues.
- Perform root cause analysis post-incident and implement solutions to prevent recurrence.

### **10. Cost Management**
- Optimize cloud and infrastructure costs while maintaining performance and reliability.
- Identify cost-saving opportunities in development and operations workflows.


### **11. Documentation**
- Document infrastructure, processes, and CI/CD workflows for team understanding.
- Maintain accurate records of configurations, deployments, and troubleshooting steps.
